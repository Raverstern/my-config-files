# My Vim Files
This repo stores my Vim configuration files. Storing Vim files this way can easily synchronize my Vim environment into new machines.

For installing easily, I write the following guidance.

## Dependency
###Git
Some important Vim plugins depend on the functionalities provided by Git. Please install it first (using Ubuntu's way as an example):
```
$ sudo apt-get install git
```

##Installation
First, clone this repo (change the following *YOUR_DIR* to certain directory, of course):
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Ricky-Gong/my-vim-files.git YOUR_DIR/
$ cd YOUR_DIR/
```

And then run the `config` script:
```
$ sh ./config.sh
```

That's it!
